# BCompTools
**Hi!** Here I post my assembler code for ![Basic Computer Emulator](https://github.com/tune-it/bcomp) and my Computer Science Basics labs.

## How do I run the program?
In order to run my program, you should copy the contents of "???.asm" file, to your BComp(directly to the text field in "Assembler" section). Then you should just press the "Compile" button,and run the program with F7 key. That's it!

*P.S. Note, that your BComp must be in 'Run' mode,to run the program. To switch the mode, just use GUI button, or,alternatively,you can use F9 hotkey instead.*

## Unsigned Integer Divider
My first tool for BComp will be the "Unsigned Integer Divider"*(Or just "****UID****")*. I think,the name tells you everything,you should know about this program.Pretty self-explainatory name. 

# Under Construction
**Below you can find some of my plans on future projects.**

## Free Memory Visualizer
The second tool, that i'll upload is "Free Memory Visualizer".It's a tool, that uses external device number 6("running line") for visualising amount of not-null RAM cells. So after you run this program, you can see the result in ED-6 window.
*P.S. This program uses the "UID" algorithm to divide the amount of non-zero cells.*
